While I was staying in Los Angeles, I found that a jQuery Conference was being held in San Francisco. I was very excited about that.  

It was around $300 for a one day session, but totally worth the money.


I drove all the way up to SF from LA. I considered flying but I just got my roadster Z4, so I drove all the way to SF. It was a lot of fun to drive!

This was the first time for me to join a tech conference in US. I was kind of worried about fully comprehending it, but Ben was careful enough to talk loud and clear for all international comers. And the slide show definitly helped as well. 

Ben started the session by giving a basic review of jQuery. All of the attendents nodded along since most of them are aquinted with jQuery and JavaScript. 
Ben had a good control of speed based on the level of topic so it was very easy for me to follow along. 

Sharing docs from the conf. I don't think it will be a problem.  
[Docs here](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B5bKzlX6SssEamF3MUl0TDVtXzg)  
You need to install nodejs. And put it in web root folder.

I personally want to highlight these. 
1. Using namespace to maintain event handlers.
1. Mange handers and objects using event boubling.
1. IIFE

Ben emphasised the IIFE part and wanted us to checkout a posting for IIFE later.

I asked him to take a pic with me :)

This was the 4th visit to SF for me there wasn't a lot of new things to do.
But it was the first time taking my car so I drove around the city.

It gets very cold at night so try to keep yourself warm.   
I hope I can make it to the next one.
