[Responsive Layout](https://github.com/zirho/layout)

# Motivation

Everytime I start a new side project, there's always a need for layout bootstrapping task. Sometimes I don't want to use anything fancy or heavy to prototype it first.

Also, there's always a common layout that I end up with, so I decided to make a generic starting point and share it with people who feel the same. 

The features that I want to include in this open-sourced repo are 

* Top fixed header
* Right side fixed sidebar
* Sticky footer
* Responsive sidebar 
* Cross browsing support
* Realtime updates for changes (browser-sync)

These features are heavily inspired by YouTube.

Hope it helps anyone out there :)
