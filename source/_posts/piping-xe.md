## What is XE? ##

XE stands for XpessEngine.   
It is an open source CMS such as Wordpress or joomla. Sponsored by NHN in South Korea.

I previously developed a wizard module(WizardXE) for the rapid composition of a website.  
I was the winner of the first competition.

PipingXE is the second module that I built to deploy or clone a website from a server to another server or just in the same machine for different environment. 

## Cloning? How? ##

I built a module to setup an exposing API for XHR request for a specific website. 
It gives all setup information for a website as a format of a serialized php object.  
The receiving part deserializes it and use it to build a website.
No more repetitive or redundant processes.

Enjoy cloning websites!
